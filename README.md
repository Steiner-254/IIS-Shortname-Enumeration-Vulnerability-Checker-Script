# IIS-Shortname-Enumeration-Vulnerability-Checker-Script
IIS Shortname Enumeration Vulnerability Checker Script


# Description:

~ This Python script checks for a potential vulnerability known as "shortname enumeration" on web servers. Shortname enumeration is a technique where an attacker attempts to guess the presence of sensitive files or directories on a server by testing variations of their filenames. This script generates a list of potential filenames based on a specified filename and sends HTTP requests to test if the server responds with a 200 status code for any of these variations.

# Usage:

1. Ensure Python 3 is installed on your system.
2. Install the requests library if not already installed:

```pip install requests
```

3. Create a file named targets.txt containing the list of target URLs to test, with one URL per line.
4. Modify the filename variable in the script to specify the filename to test.
5. Run the script:

```python3 shortname_enum_checker.py
```

# Notes:
~ The script uses the requests library to send HTTP requests to the target URLs.
~ It suppresses InsecureRequestWarning to avoid warnings about insecure HTTPS requests.
~ Timeout parameter is added to handle cases where the server is unresponsive or takes too long to respond.
~ The script reports if it detects a vulnerability indicating that shortname enumeration is possible.
